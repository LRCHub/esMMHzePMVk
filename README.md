```lrc
[00:31.05] I am not the only traveler
[00:38.05] Who has not repaid his debt
[00:44.35] I've been searching for a trail to follow again
[00:51.38] Take me back to the night we met
[01:07.38] 
[00:58.92] And then I can tell myself
[01:05.92] What the hell I'm supposed to do
[01:13.33] And then I can tell myself
[01:20.58] Not to ride along with you
[01:33.58] 
[01:27.63] I had all and then most of you
[01:30.40] Some and now none of you
[01:35.02] Take me back to the night we met
[01:42.13] I don't know what I'm supposed to do
[01:44.98] Haunted by the ghost of you
[01:49.27] Oh, take me back to the night we met
[02:07.27] 
[01:56.75] When the night was full of terror
[02:03.99] And your eyes were filled with tears
[02:11.23] When you had not touched me yet
[02:18.07] Oh! Take me back to the night we met
[02:36.07] 
[02:25.66] I had all and then most of you
[02:28.35] Some and now none of you
[02:32.83] Take me back to the night we met
[02:40.16] I don't know what I'm supposed to do
[02:42.84] Haunted by the ghost of you
[02:47.20] Take me back to the night we met
